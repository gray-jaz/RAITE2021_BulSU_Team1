Title: COVID Tracing and Vaccination Management Information System (COVID-TV MIS)

Goal and Description:
	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought changes to the way people live their lives. One of these changes is how a citizen of a nation lives. In the country, since the pandemic boomed, the government required every citizen to stay at home for their own safety. With the government’s changes in the classification of community quarantine, citizens can now get back to work and stay outdoors while following protocols such as wearing a face mask and social distancing. Even with these protocols, some citizens still fail to obey and follow, which causes the virus to spread even more. Since the virus is quick to spread, the government is having a hard time tracing its citizens infected by the virus.
One of the objectives of this project is to develop a management information system for a rural health unit (RHU) for COVID tracing. This project aims to assist in managing citizen information related to COVID tracing for the RHU, allowing them to identify their citizens who need to be quarantined and those who need medical certification after a 14-day quarantine period.
Since a year and a half past the start of the global pandemic, the government procured COVID vaccines for its citizens. This step made by the government ensures that after most of its citizens are vaccinated, the “normal” as we know could slowly go back within a given span of time. With that, this project also features how the RHU manages the vaccination information of its citizens. Citizens will be notified of their vaccination schedules on both first and second doses, should a second dose be necessary.
With such features, this project could aid in how an RHU manages its citizens’ information, specifically regarding COVID tracing and vaccination status.

Target Audience:
Rural Health Unit and its Citizens

Scope and Limitations:
This system aims to aid information management of COVID tracing in an RHU. For the RHU, the system offers ways on how they may be able to trace their citizen who are positive with the virus and do a necessary action, requiring the citizen to mandatory self-quarantine for 14 days. Moreover, once a citizen is done with the quarantine, the RHU may release a medical certificate upon the citizen’s request. For the citizens, once they are marked for self-isolation and quarantine, they will receive a system notification regarding the quarantine period. This notification will serve as a reminder for the citizen about his/her remaining days of self-quarantine.
Additionally, the system features how both RHU and citizens may manage and be informed of their vaccination status and schedule. The RHU can manage citizens’ vaccination status and what type of COVID vaccine was injected into the citizen. Moreover, the RHU can see analytics of its unit’s vaccination status to quickly determine the number of citizens vaccinated in their area. On the other hand, the citizens can identify the scheduled vaccination dates for the first and second doses (should a second dose be necessary). Once done with their vaccination, the citizen will receive a digital copy of their vaccination card as proof that they are already fully vaccinated.
However, any system is not capable of doing all things possible. In COVID tracing for the RHU, the system can only mark a citizen for self-isolation and quarantine once the citizen is reported to the RHU. RHU does not have a self-discretion regarding matters that they are not informed about. Lastly, the system can no longer identify if the citizen is following the quarantine protocols set by the government.
